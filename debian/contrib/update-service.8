.B update-service
adds or removes the

.I service-directory
resides in /etc/,
.B update-service
makes sure that the ./supervise/ subdirectories in the
.IR service-directory ,
and the optional
.IR service-directory /log/,
are symbolic links pointing into /var/lib/supervise/, unless they
already are symbolic links.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \--add | \-a
Add the service directory
.I service-directory
to the system-wide service supervision,
under the name
.IR service-name .
If
.I service-name
is not specified,
.B update-service
will use the basename of
.IR service-directory .
You can use the
.BR sv (8)
program to control the newly added service, or query its status, e.g.:

# sv status
.I service-name

.TP
.B \--remove | \-r
Remove the service directory
.IR service-directory ,
which has been added under the name

If
.I service-name
is not specified,
.B update-service
will use the basename of
.IR service-directory .
When removing the
.IR service-directory ,
the
