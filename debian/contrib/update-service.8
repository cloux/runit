.SH DESCRIPTION
.I service-directory
must be a directory to be used by
.BR runsv (8),
.I service-name
must not start with a dot, and must not contain a slash.
.P
.B update-service
adds or removes the
.I service-directory
to the system-wide service supervision provided through runit 's
.BR runsvdir (8),
lists all registered system-wide services, or checks for a specific
.I service-name
whether it is registered.
.P
When adding a service,
and the
.I service-directory
resides in /etc/,
.B update-service
makes sure that the ./supervise/ subdirectories in the
.IR service-directory ,
and the optional
.IR service-directory /log/,
are symbolic links pointing into /var/lib/supervise/, unless they
already are symbolic links.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \--add | \-a
Add the service directory
.I service-directory
to the system-wide service supervision,
under the name
.IR service-name .
If
.I service-name
is not specified,
.B update-service
will use the basename of
.IR service-directory .
You can use the
.BR sv (8)
program to control the newly added service, or query its status, e.g.:

# sv status
.I service-name

.TP
.B \--remove | \-r
Remove the service directory
.IR service-directory ,
which has been added under the name
.IR service-name ,
from the system-wide service supervision.
If
.I service-name
is not specified,
.B update-service
will use the basename of
.IR service-directory .
When removing the
.IR service-directory ,
the
.I exit
command is sent to the corresponding
.BR runsv (8)
process, telling it to take the service down and exit afterwards.
You can use the
.BR sv (8)
program to control the removed service, or query its status, e.g.:

# sv status
.I service-directory

.TP
.B \--list | \-l
If
.I service-name
is specified,
.B update-service
checks whether
.I service-name
is registered as system-wide service, prints a message and exits non-zero
if not, or prints the
.I service-name
and the directory it points to and exits zero if yes.
If
.I service-name
is not specified, it prints the names of all system-widely registered
services, one per line.
.TP
.B \--check | \-c
The same as --list, but
.B update-service
doesn't print anything to standard out or standard error.

.TP
.B \--auto | \-u
Remove the down file, if any, from the directory
.IR service-directory .
This way, the service represented by the
.IR service-directory 
will be started and monitored as soon as a runsv process is started
for that directory; the requested status of the service will be 'up'.
This is the default.
If
.I service-name
is given, will be ignored as 
.BR --auto 
directly act on the
.IR service-directory 
and thus only takes
.IR service-directory
as argument.
.TP
.B \--noauto | \-n
Touch a down file into the
.IR service-directory .
This way the service represented by
.IR service-directory
will not be automatically started when a runsv process is started for that directory.
The requested status of the service will be 'down'.
A service set to
.BR --noauto
does not start automatically at boot or when a 
.BR runsvchdir (8)
takes place,
but can still be started using the
.BR sv (8)
program, e.g.:

# sv up
.I service-name

If
.I service-name
is given, will be ignored as 
.BR --noauto 
directly act on the
.IR service-directory 
and thus only takes
.IR service-directory
as argument.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
