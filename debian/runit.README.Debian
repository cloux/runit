runit for Debian
----------------

This package provides the runit programs, an example getty service, and
adds an entry with the name SV to /etc/inittab in order to provide runit's
service supervision on systems running sysvinit as init scheme.

The package does not replace the /sbin/init program, and so does not
enable runit to run as process no 1.  To do so, you need to follow the
documentation[0].

runit's default directory for services is /etc/service/.
